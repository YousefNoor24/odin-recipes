        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            Spaghetti all'assassina, also known as spaghetti bruciati, is a Barese spaghetti dish. 
            Its preparation is markedly different from other spaghetti dishes; instead of being boiled in salted water and finished in sauce, 
            the pasta is cooked directly in the pan (traditionally cast iron). 
            A broth typically made of tomato sauce diluted with water is gradually added to the pan as the pasta absorbs it, similar to a risotto. 
            As the spaghetti absorbs the sauce, it cooks directly on the pan surface, developing significant browning and a distinctive, 
            crispy texture unique among pasta dishes.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g Spaghetti 11oz</li>
            <li>1-2 red hot chilli peppers</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>150 g Tomato concentrate 5oz</li>
            <li>1/2 Bottle of tomato passata</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Stracciatella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring 1 liter (4 cups) of water to boil in a large pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once boiling, add the tomato concentrate to the pot 
                and cook for less than 10 minutes and then take off heat and put to the side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the red hot chilli pepper into nice thin strips and finely chop the garlic cloves.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a cast iron skillet or large steel pan, add about 10-15 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the pan up to high heat. 
                Once hot, add the garlic and the chilli pepper into the olive oil and cook for 20 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomato passata to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes while stirring to help reduce the sauce. 
                Keep the pan on high heat and let the sauce create bubbles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the spaghetti into the pan by putting it down in a flat, 
                even layer and begin to push the sauce on top of the pasta and cook for about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll over your pasta to start cooking the other side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, begin to slowly add the sauce from the tomato concentrate and water into the pan, but don't move the pasta. 
                Let it sink flat in the pan and cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a little rock salt and a generous amount of pepper into the pan 
                and periodically push the sauce back on top of the pasta while you cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Push the pasta closer together and continue to cook as the pasta will continue to absorb the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the spaghetti cook for 1-2 minutes without much sauce in the pan to help the pasta get crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, continue to add in the tomato concentrate sauce. 
                The pasta should be cooked for a maximum of 8-10 minutes from the moment it is in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the pasta and spread it out around the pan so it starts to toast and get a little extra crunchiness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put extra virgin olive oil over top of the past then remove it from the pan and plate it up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top with extra virgin olive oil, black pepper, and a dollop of Stracciatella cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
